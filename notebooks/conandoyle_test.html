It is , however , unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal , and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem , or he must use matter which chance , <red>and not choice ,</red> has provided him with .
For myself , my term of service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold , <red>and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship .</red>
But the morning paper was uninteresting .
A depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday , and as to my companion , <red>neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him .</red>
He loved to lie in the very center of five millions of people , with his filaments stretching out and running through them , responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime .
<red>Appreciation of nature found no place among his many gifts ,</red> and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the country .
On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity . ''
`` Oh , <red>no !</red> ''
`` <red>Perhaps not with your tongue ,</red> my dear Watson , but certainly with your eyebrows .
But I was still far from satisfied .
`` You do yourself an injustice .
<red>Perhaps you can not yourself recall how your reverie commenced ?</red> ''
`` <red>No ,</red> <red>I can not .</red> ''
<red>But it did not lead very far .</red>
Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books .
<red>I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War ,</red> for I remember your expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people .
<red>You felt so strongly about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also .</red>
You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life .
<red>I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day .</red>
`` <red>No ,</red> <red>I saw nothing .</red> ''
<red>There is no indication as to the sender ,</red> and the matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing , who is a maiden lady of fifty , has led a most retired life , and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post .
Some years ago , however , when she resided at Penge , she let apartments in her house to three young medical students , whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits .
We have , of course , wired to the Belfast post-office , but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that day , <red>and they have no means of identifying this particular one ,</red> or of remembering the sender .
<red>The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does not help us in any way .</red>
`` <red>What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know nothing whatever about it ?</red> ''
`` <red>I have no doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business .</red> ''
<red>I wo n't have those things in here ,</red> Mr. Lestrade .
`` <red>I can not see the importance ,</red> '' said Lestrade .
What , <red>did you not observe it ?</red>
<red>I think there can be no doubt of it .</red>
The parcel was directed , then , by a man -- the printing is distinctly masculine -- of limited education and unacquainted with the town of Croydon .
`` You have observed , of course , '' said he at last , `` <red>that the ears are not a pair .</red> ''
<red>But this is not a practical joke .</red> ''
<red>These ears bear no signs of this .</red>
Again , carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the medical mind , <red>certainly not rough salt .</red>
<red>I repeat that there is no practical joke here ,</red> but that we are investigating a serious crime . ''
This brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror in the background .
The other is a man 's , sun-burned , discoloured , and also pierced for an earring .
She might have buried the ears , <red>and no one would have been the wiser .</red>
<red>But if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name .</red>
<red>I think that I have nothing further to learn from Miss Cushing .</red>
`` I am convinced , sir , '' she said , `` that this matter is a mistake , <red>and that the parcel was never meant for me at all .</red>
<red>I have not an enemy in the world ,</red> as far as I know , so why should anyone play me such a trick ? ''
I stared hard myself at her flat , grizzled hair , her trim cap , her little gilt earrings , her placid features ; but I could see nothing which could account for my companion 's evident excitement .
`` Oh , I am weary of questions ! '' cried Miss Cushing impatiently .
`` I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece , one of whom is undoubtedly yourself , <red>while the others are so exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the relationship .</red> ''
I observe that she was unmarried at the time . ''
He was on the South American line when that was taken , <red>but he was so fond of her that he could n't abide to leave her for so long ,</red> and he got into the Liverpool and London boats . ''
`` <red>No ,</red> the May Day , when last I heard .
First he dropped me , then he quarrelled with Sarah , <red>and now that Mary has stopped writing we do n't know how things are going with them .</red> ''
`` I wonder , since you are both maiden ladies , <red>that you do not keep house together .</red> ''
`` Ah ! you do n't know Sarah '<red>s temper or you would wonder no more .</red>
<red>I do n't want to say a word against my own sister ,</red> but she was always meddlesome and hard to please , was Sarah . ''
<red>And now she has no word hard enough for Jim Browner .</red>
Good-bye , and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a case with which , as you say , <red>you have nothing whatever to do .</red> ''
<red>Our drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which we had just quitted .</red>
As her medical adviser , <red>I can not possibly take the responsibility of allowing anyone to see her .</red>
`` Well , if we ca n'<red>t we ca n't ,</red> '' said Holmes , cheerfully .
`` <red>Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much .</red> ''
`` <red>I did not wish her to tell me anything .</red>
`` <red>I was never more serious in my life .</red>
`` <red>You can not effect an arrest until to-morrow night at the earliest .</red>
<red>I should prefer that you do not mention my name at all in connection with the case ,</red> as I choose to be only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in their solution .
`` <red>Your case is not complete ,</red> then ? '' I asked .
`` <red>And yet I can not see anything save very vague indications .</red> ''
`` <red>On the contrary ,</red> <red>to my mind nothing could be more clear .</red>
<red>We had formed no theories .</red>
`` As a medical man , you are aware , Watson , <red>that there is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear .</red>
This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months , so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah , he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address .
`` A second solution was at this stage obviously possible , and although I thought it exceedingly unlikely , I was determined to elucidate it before going further .
An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner , and the male ear might have belonged to the husband .
Then , of course , she might give us very important information , <red>but I was not sanguine that she would .</red>
<red>Nothing could be more conclusive .</red>
When he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade , <red>and I have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in .</red> ''
<red>Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations .</red>
He jumped up when he heard my business , and I had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police , who were round the corner , <red>but he seemed to have no heart in him ,</red> and he held out his hands quietly enough for the darbies .
We brought him along to the cells , and his box as well , for we thought there might be something incriminating ; but , bar a big sharp knife such as most sailors have , <red>we got nothing for our trouble .</red>
However , <red>we find that we shall want no more evidence ,</red> for on being brought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a statement , which was , of course , taken down , just as he made it , by our shorthand man .
The investigation really was a very simple one , '' remarked Holmes , `` <red>but I do n't think it struck him in that light when he first called us in .</red>
<red>I do n't care a plug which you do .</red>
I tell you I '<red>ve not shut an eye in sleep since I did it ,</red> <red>and I do n't believe I ever will again until I get past all waking .</red>
I '<red>m never without one or the other before me .</red>
It '<red>s not that I want to clear myself .</red>
We were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together , <red>and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my Mary .</red>
<red>But when little Mary was there I had never a thought of her ,</red> and that I swear as I hope for God 's mercy .
`` ` It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me , or to coax me out for a walk with her , <red>but I had never thought anything of that .</red>
I was impatient and paced up and down the room .
`` It '<red>s a bad compliment to me that you ca n't be contented with my society for so short a time .</red> ''
<red>There was no need for her to speak ,</red> <red>nor for me either .</red>
I was a fool to let her go on biding with us -- a besotted fool -- <red>but I never said a word to Mary ,</red> for I knew it would grieve her .
Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable , <red>and we had ceaseless rows about nothing .</red>
Sarah avoided me now , but she and Mary were just inseparable .
I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and poisoning my wife 's mind against me , <red>but I was such a blind beetle that I could not understand it at the time .</red>
Then I broke my blue ribbon and began to drink again , <red>but I think I should not have done it if Mary had been the same as ever .</red>
He was good company , <red>I wo n't deny it ,</red> and he had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man , so that I think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop than the forecastle .
For a month he was in and out of my house , <red>and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his soft ,</red> tricky ways .
I had come into the parlour unexpected , and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of welcome on my wife 's face .
<red>There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken for mine .</red>
`` <red>Do n't ,</red> Jim , <red>do n't !</red> '' says she .
`` Sarah , '' says I as I went in , `` <red>this man Fairbairn is never to darken my door again .</red> ''
`` <red>Why not ?</red> '' says she .
`` Oh ! '' says she , `` <red>if my friends are not good enough for this house ,</red> <red>then I am not good enough for it either .</red> ''
She was frightened by my face , I think , <red>for she never answered a word ,</red> and the same evening she left my house .
`` ` Well , <red>I do n't know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of this woman ,</red> or whether she thought that she could turn me against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave .
<red>How often she went I do n't know ,</red> but I followed her one day , and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got away over the back garden wall , like the cowardly skunk that he was .
<red>There was no trace of love between us any longer .</red>
`` ` Well , <red>Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool ,</red> so she went back , as I understand , to live with her sister in Croydon , and things jogged on much the same as ever at home .
The thought was in my head as I turned into my own street , and at that moment a cab passed me , and there she was , sitting by the side of Fairbairn , the two chatting and laughing , <red>with never a thought for me as I stood watching them from the footpath .</red>
`` ` I tell you , and I give you my word for it , <red>that from that moment I was not my own master ,</red> and it is all like a dim dream when I look back on it .
I had a heavy oak stick in my hand , and I tell you I saw red from the first ; but as I ran I got cunning , too , <red>and hung back a little to see them without being seen .</red>
There was a good crowd round the booking-office , <red>so I got quite close to them without being seen .</red>
When we reached it they walked along the Parade , <red>and I was never more than a hundred yards from them .</red>
There was a bit of a haze , <red>and you could not see more than a few hundred yards .</red>
I cleaned myself up , got back to land , <red>and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of what had passed .</red>
You can hang me , or do what you like with me , <red>but you can not punish me as I have been punished already .</red>
<red>I can not shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at me --</red> staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze .
<red>You wo n't put me alone into a cell ,</red> sir ?
For pity '<red>s sake do n't ,</red> and may you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now . '
It must tend to some end , or else our universe is ruled by chance , which is unthinkable .
`` Well , Mrs. Warren , <red>I can not see that you have any particular cause for uneasiness ,</red> <red>nor do I understand why I ,</red> whose time is of some value , should interfere in the matter .
`` <red>But he would never cease talking of it --</red> your kindness , sir , and the way in which you brought light into the darkness .
<red>You do n't object to tobacco ,</red> I take it ?
You are uneasy , as I understand , <red>because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you can not see him .</red>
Why , bless you , Mrs. Warren , <red>if I were your lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end .</red> ''
<red>I ca n't sleep for fright .</red>
To hear his quick step moving here and moving there from early morning to late at night , <red>and yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of him --</red> it 's more than I can stand .
My husband is as nervous over it as I am , but he is out at his work all day , <red>while I get no rest from it .</red>
` <red>If not ,</red> I '<red>ll have no more to do with you .</red> '
Also , <red>that he was to be left entirely to himself and never ,</red> upon any excuse , to be disturbed . ''
`` <red>Nothing wonderful in that ,</red> surely ? ''
`` <red>Not in reason ,</red> sir .
He has been there for ten days , and neither Mr. Warren , <red>nor I ,</red> <red>nor the girl has once set eyes upon him .</red>
We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down , up and down , night , morning , and noon ; <red>but except on that first night he had never once gone out of the house .</red> ''
<red>He told me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to bar the door .</red>
Just the word , <red>nothing more .</red>
`` Dear me , Watson , '' said Homes , staring with great curiosity at the slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him , `` this is certainly a little unusual .
`` <red>I can not imagine .</red> ''
The words are written with a broad-pointed , violet-<red>tinted pencil of a not unusual pattern .</red>
`` Youngish , sir -- <red>not over thirty .</red> ''
`` Well , <red>can you give me no further indications ?</red> ''
Dark clothes -- <red>nothing you would note .</red> ''
`` <red>He gave no name ?</red> ''
`` <red>No ,</red> sir . ''
`` <red>And has had no letters or callers ?</red> ''
`` <red>None .</red> ''
`` <red>No ,</red> sir ; he looks after himself entirely . ''
`` He had one big brown bag with him -- <red>nothing else .</red> ''
`` Well , <red>we do n't seem to have much material to help us .</red>
<red>Do you say nothing has come out of that room --</red> <red>absolutely nothing ?</red> ''
`` <red>There is nothing here ,</red> '' said he .
`` <red>I do n't understand that .</red>
`` <red>No ,</red> <red>no ;</red> the end is matted .
<red>I suppose there could not be two people in your rooms ,</red> Mrs. Warren ? ''
`` <red>No ,</red> sir .
After all , <red>you have nothing to complain of .</red>
You have received your rent , <red>and he is not a troublesome lodger ,</red> though he is certainly an unusual one .
He pays you well , <red>and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct business of yours .</red>
<red>We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for it .</red>
I 've taken up the matter , <red>and I wo n't lose sight of it .</red>
`` Well , apart from this cigarette-end , <red>was it not suggestive that the only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms ?</red>
<red>We have no proof that the person who came back was the person who went out .</red>
I can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary , <red>which would give the noun but not the plural .</red>
But surely the most valuable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual !
<red>This person is alone and can not be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired .</red>
<red>There seems no other way ,</red> and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only .
` Surely Jimmy will not break his mother 's heart ' -- that appears to be irrelevant .
` If the lady who fainted on Brixton bus ' -- <red>she does not interest me .</red>
` Every day my heart longs -- ' Bleat , Watson -- unmitigated bleat !
The mysterious one could understand English , <red>even if he could not print it .</red>
<red>Nothing for a week after that .</red>
That was in yesterday 's paper , and there is nothing in to-day 's .
If we wait a little , Watson , <red>I do n't doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible .</red> ''
`` I '<red>ll have no more of it !</red>
Well , <red>this morning he had not gone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him ,</red> threw a coat over his head , and bundled him into a cab that was beside the curb .
<red>He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab .</red>
`` <red>No ;</red> he is clean dazed .
`` Well , we '<red>ve lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came before .</red>
Money '<red>s not everything .</red>
<red>Do nothing rash .</red>
<red>What they would have done had it not been a mistake ,</red> we can only conjecture . ''
`` <red>I do n't see how that is to be managed ,</red> unless you break in the door .
Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these , a row of residential flats , <red>which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye .</red>
<red>What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman ,</red> <red>and no ordinary woman ,</red> Watson . ''
<red>It is not an easy problem ,</red> but he solved it in an original fashion , <red>and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food .</red>
<red>The man can not come near the woman ,</red> or he will guide their enemies to her .
<red>Since he can not communicate with her direct ,</red> he has recourse to the agony column of a paper .
This much we can say : <red>that it is no ordinary love escapade .</red>
The attack upon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy , whoever they are , <red>are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the male .</red>
<red>I suppose when you doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee ?</red> ''
`` <red>Education never ends ,</red> Watson .
<red>There is neither money nor credit in it ,</red> and yet one would wish to tidy it up .
<red>That ca n't be all ,</red> Watson ?
<red>ATTENTA gives no sense .</red>
<red>Nor is it any better as three words AT ,</red> TEN , TA , unless T. A. are a person 's initials .
<red>No ,</red> that seems to be the finish .
`` <red>And not a very obscure cipher ,</red> Watson , '' said he .
`` <red>Not a doubt of it .</red>
There , dimly outlined at the top window , I could see the shadow of a head , a woman 's head , gazing tensely , rigidly , out into the night , waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message .
`` <red>How you got on to it I ca n't imagine .</red> ''
<red>But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in continuing this business .</red> ''
`` I 'll do you this justice , Mr. Holmes , <red>that I was never in a case yet that I did n't feel stronger for having you on my side .</red>
We KNOW he is at the bottom of fifty murders , <red>and yet we have nothing positive we can take him on .</red>
Mr. Gregson and I ran him to ground in that big tenement house , and there 's only one door , <red>so he ca n't slip us .</red>
There 's three folk come out since he went in , but I '<red>ll swear he was n't one of them .</red> ''
`` I expect , as usual , <red>he knows a good deal that we do n't .</red> ''
`` <red>But we have no warrant for his arrest .</red> ''
`` He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances , '' said Gregson .
<red>When we have him by the heels we can see if New York ca n't help us to keep him .</red>
Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence , <red>but never in that of courage .</red>
On the deal boards of the carpetless floor there was outlined a fresh track of blood .
`` <red>Not much ,</red> Mr. Holmes , among the millions of London . ''
`` <red>Perhaps not .</red>
`` <red>Your cipher was not difficult ,</red> madam .
`` <red>I do not understand how you know these things ,</red> '' she said .
`` Well , Mrs. Lucca , '' said the prosaic Gregson , laying his hand upon the lady 's sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a Notting Hill hooligan , `` <red>I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are ;</red> but you 've said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the Yard . ''
<red>But if you think that he has acted from motives which are not criminal ,</red> and which he would wish to have known , <red>then you can not serve him better than by telling us the whole story .</red> ''
`` <red>Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing ,</red> '' said the lady .
`` He was a devil and a monster , <red>and there can be no judge in the world who would punish my husband for having killed him .</red> ''
She spoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional English , which , for the sake of clearness , I will make grammatical .
<red>He had neither money nor position --</red> <red>nothing but his beauty and strength and energy --</red> so my father forbade the match .
<red>Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more happy than I was in his presence .</red>
<red>Gennaro said nothing ,</red> but I , who knew him so well , <red>could read in his face some emotion which I had never seen there before .</red>
At first I thought that it was dislike .
And then , gradually , I understood that it was more than dislike .
That night -- the night that I read his terror -- <red>I put my arms round him and I implored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from me ,</red> and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so .
The oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were frightful , <red>but once within its rule no escape was possible .</red>
<red>Gennaro had not yet returned when he came .</red>
<red>He struck Gennaro senseless and fled from the house which he was never more to enter .</red>
By midday my husband and I were on our way to London , <red>but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of this danger ,</red> and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future .
<red>My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me .</red>
<red>I do not myself know where he lived ,</red> or how .
`` Well , Mr. Gregson , '' said the American , looking across at the official , `` <red>I do n't know what your British point of view may be ,</red> but I guess that in New York this lady 's husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks . ''
`` If what she says is corroborated , <red>I do not think she or her husband has much to fear .</red>
<red>But what I ca n't make head or tail of ,</red> Mr. Holmes , is how on earth YOU got yourself mixed up in the matter . ''
By the way , it is not eight o'clock , and a Wagner night at Covent Garden !
