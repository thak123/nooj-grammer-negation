<red>He made no remark ,</red> but the matter remained in his thoughts , for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face , smoking his pipe , and casting an occasional glance at the message .
<red>No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram .</red>
My mind is like a racing engine , <red>tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built .</red>
`` I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience , Mr. Holmes , '' said he .
`` <red>Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation .</red>
It is most improper -- most outrageous .
`` Well , sir , <red>it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the police ,</red> and yet , when you have heard the facts , <red>you must admit that I could not leave it where it was .</red>
<red>Private detectives are a class with whom I have absolutely no sympathy ,</red> <red>but none the less ,</red> having heard your name -- ''
But , in the second place , <red>why did you not come at once ?</red> ''
<red>But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking .</red> ''
Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin .
<red>I never gave a thought to my toilet .</red>
Please arrange your thoughts and let me know , in their due sequence , exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt , with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry , in search of advice and assistance . ''
Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance .
`` I 'm sure it must look very bad , Mr. Holmes , <red>and I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before .</red>
<red>You do n't mean --</red> <red>you do n't mean that I am suspected ?</red> ''
I think , Watson , <red>a brandy and soda would do him no harm .</red>
Now , sir , <red>I suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience ,</red> <red>and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted .</red> ''
He continually drummed his fingers on the table , gnawed his nails , and gave other signs of nervous impatience .
<red>The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked ,</red> <red>and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us .</red>
<red>I thought nothing of it at the time .</red>
He gave up all pretence at conversation and sat , smoking endless cigarettes , lost in his own thoughts , <red>but he made no remark as to the contents .</red>
<red>I said that I had not .</red>
<red>There was no response .</red>
<red>You can imagine my surprise when I found that there was no one there .</red>
<red>There was no answer .</red>
<red>No reply .</red>
The room was empty , <red>and the bed had never been slept in .</red>
<red>But this theory would not work .</red>
The man was unknown there .
I can assure you that every word I have said is the truth , and that , outside of what I have told you , <red>I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man .</red>
I picked this out unburned from the back of it . ''
`` <red>The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark .</red>
The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link -- what else is of such a shape ?
`` I '<red>m bound to say that I make nothing of the note except that there was something on hand ,</red> and that a woman , as usual was at the bottom of it . ''
`` <red>But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr.</red> Garcia , <red>nor what has become of his household .</red> ''
It is a lonely corner , <red>and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot .</red>
<red>There are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals .</red> ''
`` <red>No ,</red> <red>there was no attempt at robbery .</red> ''
`` This is very painful -- very painful and terrible , '' said Mr. Scott Eccles in a querulous voice , `` but it is really uncommonly hard on me .
<red>I had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and meeting so sad an end .</red>
<red>It was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it .</red>
<red>I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth .</red> ''
`` <red>I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you ,</red> Mr. Baynes ? ''
`` But that is perfectly impossible , Mr. Baynes , '' cried our client .
`` His voice is unmistakable .
`` Remarkable , <red>but by no means impossible ,</red> '' said Holmes , smiling .
`` <red>On the face of it the case is not a very complex one ,</red> though it certainly presents some novel and interesting features .
`` <red>I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles .</red> ''
`` You must admit , my dear Watson , that the idea of a joke is impossible .
There is , on the face of it , something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young Spaniard and Scott Eccles .
<red>I see no charm in the man .</red>
<red>He is not particularly intelligent --</red> <red>not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin .</red>
You saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement , extraordinary as it was . ''
`` <red>Nothing ,</red> as things turned out , but everything had they gone another way .
By some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed earlier than he thought , <red>but in any case it is likely that when Garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve .</red>
Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in the house all the time .
`` <red>I have not all my facts yet ,</red> <red>but I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties .</red>
You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories . ''
She would not have said ` Godspeed ' <red>had it not been so .</red>
`` Good , Watson , very good -- but quite inadmissable .
Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness . ''
`` <red>I do n't quite understand .</red> ''
<red>It is equally certain that this house can not be more than a mile or two from Oxshott ,</red> since Garcia was walking in that direction and hoped , according to my reading of the facts , to be back in Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi , which would only be valid up to one o'clock .
It has been a long evening , <red>and I do n't think my nerve is as good as it was .</red> ''
<red>I should not have thought you had a nerve in your body .</red> ''
<red>I do n't know what made me look up ,</red> but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane .
This is not talk for a police-constable . ''
`` I know , sir , I know ; but it shook me , sir , and there '<red>s no use to deny it .</red>
<red>It was n't black ,</red> sir , <red>nor was it white ,</red> <red>nor any colour that I know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it .</red>
I tell you , sir , <red>I could n't move a finger ,</red> <red>nor get my breath ,</red> till it whisked away and was gone .
Out I ran and through the shrubbery , <red>but thank God there was no one there .</red> ''
`` <red>If I did n't know you were a good man ,</red> Walters , I should put a black mark against you for this .
<red>If it were the devil himself a constable on duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him .</red>
<red>I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves ?</red> ''
<red>The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search .</red>
<red>Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them ,</red> and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house .
<red>Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer .</red>
`` <red>Nothing in all this ,</red> '' said Baynes , stalking , candle in hand , from room to room .
<red>He says that they are not human .</red> ''
Your powers , <red>if I may say so without offence ,</red> seem superior to your opportunities . ''
<red>I should be glad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without your help .</red> ''
<red>After his habit he said nothing ,</red> <red>and after mine I asked no questions .</red>
<red>Sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without distracting that intent brain with needless interruption .</red>
Day succeeded day , <red>and my friend took no step forward .</red>
Save for this one excursion , he spent his days in long and often solitary walks , or in chatting with a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated .
He said little about the case , <red>but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events .</red>
`` <red>You do n't mean that Baynes has got him ?</red> ''
It was suggested , <red>but never proved ,</red> that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house , and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime .
Every effort was made by Inspector Baynes , who has the case in hand , to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives , <red>and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared .</red>
<red>Pray do n't think it a liberty if I give you a word of friendly warning .</red> ''
`` I have looked into this case with some care , <red>and I am not convinced that you are on the right lines .</red>
<red>I do n't want you to commit yourself too far unless you are sure .</red> ''
`` <red>Do n't blame me .</red> ''
`` <red>No ,</red> sir ; I believe you mean well by me .
`` <red>Let us say no more about it .</red> ''
He hardly speaks a word of English , <red>and we can get nothing out of him but grunts .</red> ''
`` <red>I did n't say so ,</red> Mr. Holmes ; <red>I did n't say so .</red>
`` <red>I ca n't make the man out .</red>
But there '<red>s something in Inspector Baynes which I ca n't quite understand .</red> ''
They were all confederates in the same unknown crime .
But the attempt was a dangerous one , <red>and if Garcia did not return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed .</red>
The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me .
I wondered , as I always did , <red>how it had not been obvious to me before .</red>
`` We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious , <red>something which he could not bear to part with ,</red> had been left behind .
He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the tropics , for he is yellow and sapless , but tough as whipcord .
His friend and secretary , Mr. Lucas , is undoubtedly a foreigner , chocolate brown , wily , suave , and catlike , with a poisonous gentleness of speech .
<red>There are no better instruments than discharged servants with a grievance ,</red> and I was lucky enough to find one .
I call it luck , <red>but it would not have come my way had I not been looking out for it .</red>
He in turn had friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their master .
<red>I do n't pretend to understand it all yet ,</red> but very curious people anyway .
There 's no link between the two save for Henderson 's own servant , who serves the family 's meals .
<red>Henderson never by any chance walks alone .</red>
Where they came from , or who they are , nobody has an idea .
<red>Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder .</red>
<red>There is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant .</red>
The woman '<red>s disappearance counts for nothing ,</red> since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week .
<red>We ca n't let such a situation continue .</red>
<red>If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves .</red> ''
<red>It was not ,</red> I must confess , a very alluring prospect .
The old house with its atmosphere of murder , the singular and formidable inhabitants , the unknown dangers of the approach , and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour .
But there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend .
<red>But it was not destined that our investigation should have so adventurous an ending .</red>
<red>I sha n't forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away .</red>
`` I was sure Henderson , as he calls himself , felt that he was suspected , <red>and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger .</red>
<red>We ca n't arrest without her evidence ,</red> that is clear , so the sooner we get a statement the better . ''
Strong , fearless , and energetic , he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years .
`` <red>I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice can be gained .</red>
<red>To us there is no fiend in hell like Juan Murillo ,</red> <red>and no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance .</red> ''
But the many whose lives he had ruined , whose nearest and dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands , <red>would not let the matter rest .</red>
<red>They banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the work was done .</red>
He could do little during the day , <red>for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas ,</red> or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness .
<red>How they murdered him I do not know ,</red> save that it was Murillo 's hand who struck him down , for Lopez had remained to guard me .
`` <red>All would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge of what they had done .</red>
<red>I have no doubt that there were times when my life hung in the balance .</red>
I sprang out , they tried to drag me back , <red>and had it not been for the help of this good man ,</red> who led me to the cab , <red>I should never had broken away .</red>
`` <red>Our difficulties are not over ,</red> '' he remarked , shaking his head .
<red>No ,</red> <red>no ,</red> we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of High Gable at the next Guildford Assizes . ''
<red>From that day they were seen no more in England .</red>
The crime was ascribed to Nihilism , <red>and the murderers were never arrested .</red>
<red>We could not doubt that justice ,</red> if belated , had come at last .
`` <red>It will not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is dear to your heart .</red>
<red>Is there any point which is not quite clear to you ?</red> ''
`` ` <red>The true voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods .</red>
