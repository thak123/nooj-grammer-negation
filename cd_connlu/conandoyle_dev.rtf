\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\f0\fs24 He made no remark ,\cf2  but the matter remained in his thoughts , for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face , smoking his pipe , and casting an occasional glance at the message .\par
\cf1 No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram .\cf2\par
My mind is like a racing engine , \cf1 tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built .\cf2\par
`` I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience , Mr. Holmes , '' said he .\par
`` \cf1 Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation .\cf2\par
It is most improper -- most outrageous .\par
`` Well , sir , \cf1 it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the police ,\cf2  and yet , when you have heard the facts , \cf1 you must admit that I could not leave it where it was .\cf2\par
\cf1 Private detectives are a class with whom I have absolutely no sympathy ,\cf2  \cf1 but none the less ,\cf2  having heard your name -- ''\par
But , in the second place , \cf1 why did you not come at once ?\cf2  ''\par
\cf1 But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking .\cf2  ''\par
Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin .\par
\cf1 I never gave a thought to my toilet .\cf2\par
Please arrange your thoughts and let me know , in their due sequence , exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt , with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry , in search of advice and assistance . ''\par
Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance .\par
`` I 'm sure it must look very bad , Mr. Holmes , \cf1 and I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before .\cf2\par
\cf1 You do n't mean --\cf2  \cf1 you do n't mean that I am suspected ?\cf2  ''\par
I think , Watson , \cf1 a brandy and soda would do him no harm .\cf2\par
Now , sir , \cf1 I suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience ,\cf2  \cf1 and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted .\cf2  ''\par
He continually drummed his fingers on the table , gnawed his nails , and gave other signs of nervous impatience .\par
\cf1 The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked ,\cf2  \cf1 and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us .\cf2\par
\cf1 I thought nothing of it at the time .\cf2\par
He gave up all pretence at conversation and sat , smoking endless cigarettes , lost in his own thoughts , \cf1 but he made no remark as to the contents .\cf2\par
\cf1 I said that I had not .\cf2\par
\cf1 There was no response .\cf2\par
\cf1 You can imagine my surprise when I found that there was no one there .\cf2\par
\cf1 There was no answer .\cf2\par
\cf1 No reply .\cf2\par
The room was empty , \cf1 and the bed had never been slept in .\cf2\par
\cf1 But this theory would not work .\cf2\par
The man was unknown there .\par
I can assure you that every word I have said is the truth , and that , outside of what I have told you , \cf1 I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man .\cf2\par
I picked this out unburned from the back of it . ''\par
`` \cf1 The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark .\cf2\par
The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link -- what else is of such a shape ?\par
`` I '\cf1 m bound to say that I make nothing of the note except that there was something on hand ,\cf2  and that a woman , as usual was at the bottom of it . ''\par
`` \cf1 But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr.\cf2  Garcia , \cf1 nor what has become of his household .\cf2  ''\par
It is a lonely corner , \cf1 and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot .\cf2\par
\cf1 There are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals .\cf2  ''\par
`` \cf1 No ,\cf2  \cf1 there was no attempt at robbery .\cf2  ''\par
`` This is very painful -- very painful and terrible , '' said Mr. Scott Eccles in a querulous voice , `` but it is really uncommonly hard on me .\par
\cf1 I had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and meeting so sad an end .\cf2\par
\cf1 It was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it .\cf2\par
\cf1 I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth .\cf2  ''\par
`` \cf1 I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you ,\cf2  Mr. Baynes ? ''\par
`` But that is perfectly impossible , Mr. Baynes , '' cried our client .\par
`` His voice is unmistakable .\par
`` Remarkable , \cf1 but by no means impossible ,\cf2  '' said Holmes , smiling .\par
`` \cf1 On the face of it the case is not a very complex one ,\cf2  though it certainly presents some novel and interesting features .\par
`` \cf1 I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles .\cf2  ''\par
`` You must admit , my dear Watson , that the idea of a joke is impossible .\par
There is , on the face of it , something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young Spaniard and Scott Eccles .\par
\cf1 I see no charm in the man .\cf2\par
\cf1 He is not particularly intelligent --\cf2  \cf1 not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin .\cf2\par
You saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement , extraordinary as it was . ''\par
`` \cf1 Nothing ,\cf2  as things turned out , but everything had they gone another way .\par
By some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed earlier than he thought , \cf1 but in any case it is likely that when Garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve .\cf2\par
Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in the house all the time .\par
`` \cf1 I have not all my facts yet ,\cf2  \cf1 but I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties .\cf2\par
You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories . ''\par
She would not have said ` Godspeed ' \cf1 had it not been so .\cf2\par
`` Good , Watson , very good -- but quite inadmissable .\par
Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness . ''\par
`` \cf1 I do n't quite understand .\cf2  ''\par
\cf1 It is equally certain that this house can not be more than a mile or two from Oxshott ,\cf2  since Garcia was walking in that direction and hoped , according to my reading of the facts , to be back in Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi , which would only be valid up to one o'clock .\par
It has been a long evening , \cf1 and I do n't think my nerve is as good as it was .\cf2  ''\par
\cf1 I should not have thought you had a nerve in your body .\cf2  ''\par
\cf1 I do n't know what made me look up ,\cf2  but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane .\par
This is not talk for a police-constable . ''\par
`` I know , sir , I know ; but it shook me , sir , and there '\cf1 s no use to deny it .\cf2\par
\cf1 It was n't black ,\cf2  sir , \cf1 nor was it white ,\cf2  \cf1 nor any colour that I know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it .\cf2\par
I tell you , sir , \cf1 I could n't move a finger ,\cf2  \cf1 nor get my breath ,\cf2  till it whisked away and was gone .\par
Out I ran and through the shrubbery , \cf1 but thank God there was no one there .\cf2  ''\par
`` \cf1 If I did n't know you were a good man ,\cf2  Walters , I should put a black mark against you for this .\par
\cf1 If it were the devil himself a constable on duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him .\cf2\par
\cf1 I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves ?\cf2  ''\par
\cf1 The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search .\cf2\par
\cf1 Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them ,\cf2  and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house .\par
\cf1 Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer .\cf2\par
`` \cf1 Nothing in all this ,\cf2  '' said Baynes , stalking , candle in hand , from room to room .\par
\cf1 He says that they are not human .\cf2  ''\par
Your powers , \cf1 if I may say so without offence ,\cf2  seem superior to your opportunities . ''\par
\cf1 I should be glad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without your help .\cf2  ''\par
\cf1 After his habit he said nothing ,\cf2  \cf1 and after mine I asked no questions .\cf2\par
\cf1 Sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without distracting that intent brain with needless interruption .\cf2\par
Day succeeded day , \cf1 and my friend took no step forward .\cf2\par
Save for this one excursion , he spent his days in long and often solitary walks , or in chatting with a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated .\par
He said little about the case , \cf1 but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events .\cf2\par
`` \cf1 You do n't mean that Baynes has got him ?\cf2  ''\par
It was suggested , \cf1 but never proved ,\cf2  that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house , and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime .\par
Every effort was made by Inspector Baynes , who has the case in hand , to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives , \cf1 and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared .\cf2\par
\cf1 Pray do n't think it a liberty if I give you a word of friendly warning .\cf2  ''\par
`` I have looked into this case with some care , \cf1 and I am not convinced that you are on the right lines .\cf2\par
\cf1 I do n't want you to commit yourself too far unless you are sure .\cf2  ''\par
`` \cf1 Do n't blame me .\cf2  ''\par
`` \cf1 No ,\cf2  sir ; I believe you mean well by me .\par
`` \cf1 Let us say no more about it .\cf2  ''\par
He hardly speaks a word of English , \cf1 and we can get nothing out of him but grunts .\cf2  ''\par
`` \cf1 I did n't say so ,\cf2  Mr. Holmes ; \cf1 I did n't say so .\cf2\par
`` \cf1 I ca n't make the man out .\cf2\par
But there '\cf1 s something in Inspector Baynes which I ca n't quite understand .\cf2  ''\par
They were all confederates in the same unknown crime .\par
But the attempt was a dangerous one , \cf1 and if Garcia did not return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed .\cf2\par
The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me .\par
I wondered , as I always did , \cf1 how it had not been obvious to me before .\cf2\par
`` We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious , \cf1 something which he could not bear to part with ,\cf2  had been left behind .\par
He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the tropics , for he is yellow and sapless , but tough as whipcord .\par
His friend and secretary , Mr. Lucas , is undoubtedly a foreigner , chocolate brown , wily , suave , and catlike , with a poisonous gentleness of speech .\par
\cf1 There are no better instruments than discharged servants with a grievance ,\cf2  and I was lucky enough to find one .\par
I call it luck , \cf1 but it would not have come my way had I not been looking out for it .\cf2\par
He in turn had friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their master .\par
\cf1 I do n't pretend to understand it all yet ,\cf2  but very curious people anyway .\par
There 's no link between the two save for Henderson 's own servant , who serves the family 's meals .\par
\cf1 Henderson never by any chance walks alone .\cf2\par
Where they came from , or who they are , nobody has an idea .\par
\cf1 Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder .\cf2\par
\cf1 There is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant .\cf2\par
The woman '\cf1 s disappearance counts for nothing ,\cf2  since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week .\par
\cf1 We ca n't let such a situation continue .\cf2\par
\cf1 If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves .\cf2  ''\par
\cf1 It was not ,\cf2  I must confess , a very alluring prospect .\par
The old house with its atmosphere of murder , the singular and formidable inhabitants , the unknown dangers of the approach , and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour .\par
But there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend .\par
\cf1 But it was not destined that our investigation should have so adventurous an ending .\cf2\par
\cf1 I sha n't forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away .\cf2\par
`` I was sure Henderson , as he calls himself , felt that he was suspected , \cf1 and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger .\cf2\par
\cf1 We ca n't arrest without her evidence ,\cf2  that is clear , so the sooner we get a statement the better . ''\par
Strong , fearless , and energetic , he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years .\par
`` \cf1 I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice can be gained .\cf2\par
\cf1 To us there is no fiend in hell like Juan Murillo ,\cf2  \cf1 and no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance .\cf2  ''\par
But the many whose lives he had ruined , whose nearest and dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands , \cf1 would not let the matter rest .\cf2\par
\cf1 They banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the work was done .\cf2\par
He could do little during the day , \cf1 for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas ,\cf2  or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness .\par
\cf1 How they murdered him I do not know ,\cf2  save that it was Murillo 's hand who struck him down , for Lopez had remained to guard me .\par
`` \cf1 All would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge of what they had done .\cf2\par
\cf1 I have no doubt that there were times when my life hung in the balance .\cf2\par
I sprang out , they tried to drag me back , \cf1 and had it not been for the help of this good man ,\cf2  who led me to the cab , \cf1 I should never had broken away .\cf2\par
`` \cf1 Our difficulties are not over ,\cf2  '' he remarked , shaking his head .\par
\cf1 No ,\cf2  \cf1 no ,\cf2  we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of High Gable at the next Guildford Assizes . ''\par
\cf1 From that day they were seen no more in England .\cf2\par
The crime was ascribed to Nihilism , \cf1 and the murderers were never arrested .\cf2\par
\cf1 We could not doubt that justice ,\cf2  if belated , had come at last .\par
`` \cf1 It will not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is dear to your heart .\cf2\par
\cf1 Is there any point which is not quite clear to you ?\cf2  ''\par
`` ` \cf1 The true voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods .\cf0\par
