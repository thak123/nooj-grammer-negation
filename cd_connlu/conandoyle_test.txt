It is , however , unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal , and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem , or he must use matter which chance , and not choice , has provided him with .
For myself , my term of service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold , and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship .
But the morning paper was uninteresting .
A depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday , and as to my companion , neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him .
He loved to lie in the very center of five millions of people , with his filaments stretching out and running through them , responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime .
Appreciation of nature found no place among his many gifts , and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the country .
On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity . ''
`` Oh , no ! ''
`` Perhaps not with your tongue , my dear Watson , but certainly with your eyebrows .
But I was still far from satisfied .
`` You do yourself an injustice .
Perhaps you can not yourself recall how your reverie commenced ? ''
`` No , I can not . ''
But it did not lead very far .
Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books .
I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War , for I remember your expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people .
You felt so strongly about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also .
You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life .
I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day .
`` No , I saw nothing . ''
There is no indication as to the sender , and the matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing , who is a maiden lady of fifty , has led a most retired life , and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post .
Some years ago , however , when she resided at Penge , she let apartments in her house to three young medical students , whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits .
We have , of course , wired to the Belfast post-office , but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that day , and they have no means of identifying this particular one , or of remembering the sender .
The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does not help us in any way .
`` What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know nothing whatever about it ? ''
`` I have no doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business . ''
I wo n't have those things in here , Mr. Lestrade .
`` I can not see the importance , '' said Lestrade .
What , did you not observe it ?
I think there can be no doubt of it .
The parcel was directed , then , by a man -- the printing is distinctly masculine -- of limited education and unacquainted with the town of Croydon .
`` You have observed , of course , '' said he at last , `` that the ears are not a pair . ''
But this is not a practical joke . ''
These ears bear no signs of this .
Again , carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the medical mind , certainly not rough salt .
I repeat that there is no practical joke here , but that we are investigating a serious crime . ''
This brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror in the background .
The other is a man 's , sun-burned , discoloured , and also pierced for an earring .
She might have buried the ears , and no one would have been the wiser .
But if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name .
I think that I have nothing further to learn from Miss Cushing .
`` I am convinced , sir , '' she said , `` that this matter is a mistake , and that the parcel was never meant for me at all .
I have not an enemy in the world , as far as I know , so why should anyone play me such a trick ? ''
I stared hard myself at her flat , grizzled hair , her trim cap , her little gilt earrings , her placid features ; but I could see nothing which could account for my companion 's evident excitement .
`` Oh , I am weary of questions ! '' cried Miss Cushing impatiently .
`` I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece , one of whom is undoubtedly yourself , while the others are so exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the relationship . ''
I observe that she was unmarried at the time . ''
He was on the South American line when that was taken , but he was so fond of her that he could n't abide to leave her for so long , and he got into the Liverpool and London boats . ''
`` No , the May Day , when last I heard .
First he dropped me , then he quarrelled with Sarah , and now that Mary has stopped writing we do n't know how things are going with them . ''
`` I wonder , since you are both maiden ladies , that you do not keep house together . ''
`` Ah ! you do n't know Sarah 's temper or you would wonder no more .
I do n't want to say a word against my own sister , but she was always meddlesome and hard to please , was Sarah . ''
And now she has no word hard enough for Jim Browner .
Good-bye , and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a case with which , as you say , you have nothing whatever to do . ''
Our drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which we had just quitted .
As her medical adviser , I can not possibly take the responsibility of allowing anyone to see her .
`` Well , if we ca n't we ca n't , '' said Holmes , cheerfully .
`` Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much . ''
`` I did not wish her to tell me anything .
`` I was never more serious in my life .
`` You can not effect an arrest until to-morrow night at the earliest .
I should prefer that you do not mention my name at all in connection with the case , as I choose to be only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in their solution .
`` Your case is not complete , then ? '' I asked .
`` And yet I can not see anything save very vague indications . ''
`` On the contrary , to my mind nothing could be more clear .
We had formed no theories .
`` As a medical man , you are aware , Watson , that there is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear .
This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months , so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah , he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address .
`` A second solution was at this stage obviously possible , and although I thought it exceedingly unlikely , I was determined to elucidate it before going further .
An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner , and the male ear might have belonged to the husband .
Then , of course , she might give us very important information , but I was not sanguine that she would .
Nothing could be more conclusive .
When he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade , and I have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in . ''
Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations .
He jumped up when he heard my business , and I had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police , who were round the corner , but he seemed to have no heart in him , and he held out his hands quietly enough for the darbies .
We brought him along to the cells , and his box as well , for we thought there might be something incriminating ; but , bar a big sharp knife such as most sailors have , we got nothing for our trouble .
However , we find that we shall want no more evidence , for on being brought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a statement , which was , of course , taken down , just as he made it , by our shorthand man .
The investigation really was a very simple one , '' remarked Holmes , `` but I do n't think it struck him in that light when he first called us in .
I do n't care a plug which you do .
I tell you I 've not shut an eye in sleep since I did it , and I do n't believe I ever will again until I get past all waking .
I 'm never without one or the other before me .
It 's not that I want to clear myself .
We were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together , and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my Mary .
But when little Mary was there I had never a thought of her , and that I swear as I hope for God 's mercy .
`` ` It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me , or to coax me out for a walk with her , but I had never thought anything of that .
I was impatient and paced up and down the room .
`` It 's a bad compliment to me that you ca n't be contented with my society for so short a time . ''
There was no need for her to speak , nor for me either .
I was a fool to let her go on biding with us -- a besotted fool -- but I never said a word to Mary , for I knew it would grieve her .
Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable , and we had ceaseless rows about nothing .
Sarah avoided me now , but she and Mary were just inseparable .
I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and poisoning my wife 's mind against me , but I was such a blind beetle that I could not understand it at the time .
Then I broke my blue ribbon and began to drink again , but I think I should not have done it if Mary had been the same as ever .
He was good company , I wo n't deny it , and he had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man , so that I think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop than the forecastle .
For a month he was in and out of my house , and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his soft , tricky ways .
I had come into the parlour unexpected , and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of welcome on my wife 's face .
There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken for mine .
`` Do n't , Jim , do n't ! '' says she .
`` Sarah , '' says I as I went in , `` this man Fairbairn is never to darken my door again . ''
`` Why not ? '' says she .
`` Oh ! '' says she , `` if my friends are not good enough for this house , then I am not good enough for it either . ''
She was frightened by my face , I think , for she never answered a word , and the same evening she left my house .
`` ` Well , I do n't know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of this woman , or whether she thought that she could turn me against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave .
How often she went I do n't know , but I followed her one day , and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got away over the back garden wall , like the cowardly skunk that he was .
There was no trace of love between us any longer .
`` ` Well , Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool , so she went back , as I understand , to live with her sister in Croydon , and things jogged on much the same as ever at home .
The thought was in my head as I turned into my own street , and at that moment a cab passed me , and there she was , sitting by the side of Fairbairn , the two chatting and laughing , with never a thought for me as I stood watching them from the footpath .
`` ` I tell you , and I give you my word for it , that from that moment I was not my own master , and it is all like a dim dream when I look back on it .
I had a heavy oak stick in my hand , and I tell you I saw red from the first ; but as I ran I got cunning , too , and hung back a little to see them without being seen .
There was a good crowd round the booking-office , so I got quite close to them without being seen .
When we reached it they walked along the Parade , and I was never more than a hundred yards from them .
There was a bit of a haze , and you could not see more than a few hundred yards .
I cleaned myself up , got back to land , and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of what had passed .
You can hang me , or do what you like with me , but you can not punish me as I have been punished already .
I can not shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at me -- staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze .
You wo n't put me alone into a cell , sir ?
For pity 's sake do n't , and may you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now . '
It must tend to some end , or else our universe is ruled by chance , which is unthinkable .
`` Well , Mrs. Warren , I can not see that you have any particular cause for uneasiness , nor do I understand why I , whose time is of some value , should interfere in the matter .
`` But he would never cease talking of it -- your kindness , sir , and the way in which you brought light into the darkness .
You do n't object to tobacco , I take it ?
You are uneasy , as I understand , because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you can not see him .
Why , bless you , Mrs. Warren , if I were your lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end . ''
I ca n't sleep for fright .
To hear his quick step moving here and moving there from early morning to late at night , and yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of him -- it 's more than I can stand .
My husband is as nervous over it as I am , but he is out at his work all day , while I get no rest from it .
` If not , I 'll have no more to do with you . '
Also , that he was to be left entirely to himself and never , upon any excuse , to be disturbed . ''
`` Nothing wonderful in that , surely ? ''
`` Not in reason , sir .
He has been there for ten days , and neither Mr. Warren , nor I , nor the girl has once set eyes upon him .
We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down , up and down , night , morning , and noon ; but except on that first night he had never once gone out of the house . ''
He told me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to bar the door .
Just the word , nothing more .
`` Dear me , Watson , '' said Homes , staring with great curiosity at the slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him , `` this is certainly a little unusual .
`` I can not imagine . ''
The words are written with a broad-pointed , violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual pattern .
`` Youngish , sir -- not over thirty . ''
`` Well , can you give me no further indications ? ''
Dark clothes -- nothing you would note . ''
`` He gave no name ? ''
`` No , sir . ''
`` And has had no letters or callers ? ''
`` None . ''
`` No , sir ; he looks after himself entirely . ''
`` He had one big brown bag with him -- nothing else . ''
`` Well , we do n't seem to have much material to help us .
Do you say nothing has come out of that room -- absolutely nothing ? ''
`` There is nothing here , '' said he .
`` I do n't understand that .
`` No , no ; the end is matted .
I suppose there could not be two people in your rooms , Mrs. Warren ? ''
`` No , sir .
After all , you have nothing to complain of .
You have received your rent , and he is not a troublesome lodger , though he is certainly an unusual one .
He pays you well , and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct business of yours .
We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for it .
I 've taken up the matter , and I wo n't lose sight of it .
`` Well , apart from this cigarette-end , was it not suggestive that the only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms ?
We have no proof that the person who came back was the person who went out .
I can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary , which would give the noun but not the plural .
But surely the most valuable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual !
This person is alone and can not be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired .
There seems no other way , and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only .
` Surely Jimmy will not break his mother 's heart ' -- that appears to be irrelevant .
` If the lady who fainted on Brixton bus ' -- she does not interest me .
` Every day my heart longs -- ' Bleat , Watson -- unmitigated bleat !
The mysterious one could understand English , even if he could not print it .
Nothing for a week after that .
That was in yesterday 's paper , and there is nothing in to-day 's .
If we wait a little , Watson , I do n't doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible . ''
`` I 'll have no more of it !
Well , this morning he had not gone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him , threw a coat over his head , and bundled him into a cab that was beside the curb .
He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab .
`` No ; he is clean dazed .
`` Well , we 've lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came before .
Money 's not everything .
Do nothing rash .
What they would have done had it not been a mistake , we can only conjecture . ''
`` I do n't see how that is to be managed , unless you break in the door .
Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these , a row of residential flats , which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye .
What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman , and no ordinary woman , Watson . ''
It is not an easy problem , but he solved it in an original fashion , and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food .
The man can not come near the woman , or he will guide their enemies to her .
Since he can not communicate with her direct , he has recourse to the agony column of a paper .
This much we can say : that it is no ordinary love escapade .
The attack upon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy , whoever they are , are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the male .
I suppose when you doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee ? ''
`` Education never ends , Watson .
There is neither money nor credit in it , and yet one would wish to tidy it up .
That ca n't be all , Watson ?
ATTENTA gives no sense .
Nor is it any better as three words AT , TEN , TA , unless T. A. are a person 's initials .
No , that seems to be the finish .
`` And not a very obscure cipher , Watson , '' said he .
`` Not a doubt of it .
There , dimly outlined at the top window , I could see the shadow of a head , a woman 's head , gazing tensely , rigidly , out into the night , waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message .
`` How you got on to it I ca n't imagine . ''
But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in continuing this business . ''
`` I 'll do you this justice , Mr. Holmes , that I was never in a case yet that I did n't feel stronger for having you on my side .
We KNOW he is at the bottom of fifty murders , and yet we have nothing positive we can take him on .
Mr. Gregson and I ran him to ground in that big tenement house , and there 's only one door , so he ca n't slip us .
There 's three folk come out since he went in , but I 'll swear he was n't one of them . ''
`` I expect , as usual , he knows a good deal that we do n't . ''
`` But we have no warrant for his arrest . ''
`` He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances , '' said Gregson .
When we have him by the heels we can see if New York ca n't help us to keep him .
Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence , but never in that of courage .
On the deal boards of the carpetless floor there was outlined a fresh track of blood .
`` Not much , Mr. Holmes , among the millions of London . ''
`` Perhaps not .
`` Your cipher was not difficult , madam .
`` I do not understand how you know these things , '' she said .
`` Well , Mrs. Lucca , '' said the prosaic Gregson , laying his hand upon the lady 's sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a Notting Hill hooligan , `` I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are ; but you 've said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the Yard . ''
But if you think that he has acted from motives which are not criminal , and which he would wish to have known , then you can not serve him better than by telling us the whole story . ''
`` Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing , '' said the lady .
`` He was a devil and a monster , and there can be no judge in the world who would punish my husband for having killed him . ''
She spoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional English , which , for the sake of clearness , I will make grammatical .
He had neither money nor position -- nothing but his beauty and strength and energy -- so my father forbade the match .
Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more happy than I was in his presence .
Gennaro said nothing , but I , who knew him so well , could read in his face some emotion which I had never seen there before .
At first I thought that it was dislike .
And then , gradually , I understood that it was more than dislike .
That night -- the night that I read his terror -- I put my arms round him and I implored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from me , and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so .
The oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were frightful , but once within its rule no escape was possible .
Gennaro had not yet returned when he came .
He struck Gennaro senseless and fled from the house which he was never more to enter .
By midday my husband and I were on our way to London , but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of this danger , and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future .
My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me .
I do not myself know where he lived , or how .
`` Well , Mr. Gregson , '' said the American , looking across at the official , `` I do n't know what your British point of view may be , but I guess that in New York this lady 's husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks . ''
`` If what she says is corroborated , I do not think she or her husband has much to fear .
But what I ca n't make head or tail of , Mr. Holmes , is how on earth YOU got yourself mixed up in the matter . ''
By the way , it is not eight o'clock , and a Wagner night at Covent Garden !
