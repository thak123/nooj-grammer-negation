He made no remark , but the matter remained in his thoughts , for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face , smoking his pipe , and casting an occasional glance at the message .
No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram .
My mind is like a racing engine , tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built .
`` I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience , Mr. Holmes , '' said he .
`` Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation .
It is most improper -- most outrageous .
`` Well , sir , it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the police , and yet , when you have heard the facts , you must admit that I could not leave it where it was .
Private detectives are a class with whom I have absolutely no sympathy , but none the less , having heard your name -- ''
But , in the second place , why did you not come at once ? ''
But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking . ''
Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin .
I never gave a thought to my toilet .
Please arrange your thoughts and let me know , in their due sequence , exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt , with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry , in search of advice and assistance . ''
Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance .
`` I 'm sure it must look very bad , Mr. Holmes , and I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before .
You do n't mean -- you do n't mean that I am suspected ? ''
I think , Watson , a brandy and soda would do him no harm .
Now , sir , I suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience , and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted . ''
He continually drummed his fingers on the table , gnawed his nails , and gave other signs of nervous impatience .
The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked , and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us .
I thought nothing of it at the time .
He gave up all pretence at conversation and sat , smoking endless cigarettes , lost in his own thoughts , but he made no remark as to the contents .
I said that I had not .
There was no response .
You can imagine my surprise when I found that there was no one there .
There was no answer .
No reply .
The room was empty , and the bed had never been slept in .
But this theory would not work .
The man was unknown there .
I can assure you that every word I have said is the truth , and that , outside of what I have told you , I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man .
I picked this out unburned from the back of it . ''
`` The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark .
The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link -- what else is of such a shape ?
`` I 'm bound to say that I make nothing of the note except that there was something on hand , and that a woman , as usual was at the bottom of it . ''
`` But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr. Garcia , nor what has become of his household . ''
It is a lonely corner , and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot .
There are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals . ''
`` No , there was no attempt at robbery . ''
`` This is very painful -- very painful and terrible , '' said Mr. Scott Eccles in a querulous voice , `` but it is really uncommonly hard on me .
I had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and meeting so sad an end .
It was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it .
I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth . ''
`` I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you , Mr. Baynes ? ''
`` But that is perfectly impossible , Mr. Baynes , '' cried our client .
`` His voice is unmistakable .
`` Remarkable , but by no means impossible , '' said Holmes , smiling .
`` On the face of it the case is not a very complex one , though it certainly presents some novel and interesting features .
`` I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles . ''
`` You must admit , my dear Watson , that the idea of a joke is impossible .
There is , on the face of it , something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young Spaniard and Scott Eccles .
I see no charm in the man .
He is not particularly intelligent -- not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin .
You saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement , extraordinary as it was . ''
`` Nothing , as things turned out , but everything had they gone another way .
By some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed earlier than he thought , but in any case it is likely that when Garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve .
Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in the house all the time .
`` I have not all my facts yet , but I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties .
You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories . ''
She would not have said ` Godspeed ' had it not been so .
`` Good , Watson , very good -- but quite inadmissable .
Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness . ''
`` I do n't quite understand . ''
It is equally certain that this house can not be more than a mile or two from Oxshott , since Garcia was walking in that direction and hoped , according to my reading of the facts , to be back in Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi , which would only be valid up to one o'clock .
It has been a long evening , and I do n't think my nerve is as good as it was . ''
I should not have thought you had a nerve in your body . ''
I do n't know what made me look up , but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane .
This is not talk for a police-constable . ''
`` I know , sir , I know ; but it shook me , sir , and there 's no use to deny it .
It was n't black , sir , nor was it white , nor any colour that I know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it .
I tell you , sir , I could n't move a finger , nor get my breath , till it whisked away and was gone .
Out I ran and through the shrubbery , but thank God there was no one there . ''
`` If I did n't know you were a good man , Walters , I should put a black mark against you for this .
If it were the devil himself a constable on duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him .
I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves ? ''
The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search .
Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them , and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house .
Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer .
`` Nothing in all this , '' said Baynes , stalking , candle in hand , from room to room .
He says that they are not human . ''
Your powers , if I may say so without offence , seem superior to your opportunities . ''
I should be glad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without your help . ''
After his habit he said nothing , and after mine I asked no questions .
Sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without distracting that intent brain with needless interruption .
Day succeeded day , and my friend took no step forward .
Save for this one excursion , he spent his days in long and often solitary walks , or in chatting with a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated .
He said little about the case , but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events .
`` You do n't mean that Baynes has got him ? ''
It was suggested , but never proved , that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house , and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime .
Every effort was made by Inspector Baynes , who has the case in hand , to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives , and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared .
Pray do n't think it a liberty if I give you a word of friendly warning . ''
`` I have looked into this case with some care , and I am not convinced that you are on the right lines .
I do n't want you to commit yourself too far unless you are sure . ''
`` Do n't blame me . ''
`` No , sir ; I believe you mean well by me .
`` Let us say no more about it . ''
He hardly speaks a word of English , and we can get nothing out of him but grunts . ''
`` I did n't say so , Mr. Holmes ; I did n't say so .
`` I ca n't make the man out .
But there 's something in Inspector Baynes which I ca n't quite understand . ''
They were all confederates in the same unknown crime .
But the attempt was a dangerous one , and if Garcia did not return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed .
The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me .
I wondered , as I always did , how it had not been obvious to me before .
`` We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious , something which he could not bear to part with , had been left behind .
He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the tropics , for he is yellow and sapless , but tough as whipcord .
His friend and secretary , Mr. Lucas , is undoubtedly a foreigner , chocolate brown , wily , suave , and catlike , with a poisonous gentleness of speech .
There are no better instruments than discharged servants with a grievance , and I was lucky enough to find one .
I call it luck , but it would not have come my way had I not been looking out for it .
He in turn had friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their master .
I do n't pretend to understand it all yet , but very curious people anyway .
There 's no link between the two save for Henderson 's own servant , who serves the family 's meals .
Henderson never by any chance walks alone .
Where they came from , or who they are , nobody has an idea .
Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder .
There is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant .
The woman 's disappearance counts for nothing , since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week .
We ca n't let such a situation continue .
If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves . ''
It was not , I must confess , a very alluring prospect .
The old house with its atmosphere of murder , the singular and formidable inhabitants , the unknown dangers of the approach , and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour .
But there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend .
But it was not destined that our investigation should have so adventurous an ending .
I sha n't forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away .
`` I was sure Henderson , as he calls himself , felt that he was suspected , and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger .
We ca n't arrest without her evidence , that is clear , so the sooner we get a statement the better . ''
Strong , fearless , and energetic , he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years .
`` I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice can be gained .
To us there is no fiend in hell like Juan Murillo , and no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance . ''
But the many whose lives he had ruined , whose nearest and dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands , would not let the matter rest .
They banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the work was done .
He could do little during the day , for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas , or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness .
How they murdered him I do not know , save that it was Murillo 's hand who struck him down , for Lopez had remained to guard me .
`` All would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge of what they had done .
I have no doubt that there were times when my life hung in the balance .
I sprang out , they tried to drag me back , and had it not been for the help of this good man , who led me to the cab , I should never had broken away .
`` Our difficulties are not over , '' he remarked , shaking his head .
No , no , we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of High Gable at the next Guildford Assizes . ''
From that day they were seen no more in England .
The crime was ascribed to Nihilism , and the murderers were never arrested .
We could not doubt that justice , if belated , had come at last .
`` It will not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is dear to your heart .
Is there any point which is not quite clear to you ? ''
`` ` The true voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods .
