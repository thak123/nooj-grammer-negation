\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\f0\fs24 It is , however , unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal , and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem , or he must use matter which chance , \cf2 and not choice ,\cf1  has provided him with .\par
For myself , my term of service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold , \cf2 and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship .\cf1\par
But the morning paper was uninteresting .\par
A depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday , and as to my companion , \cf2 neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him .\cf1\par
He loved to lie in the very center of five millions of people , with his filaments stretching out and running through them , responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime .\par
\cf2 Appreciation of nature found no place among his many gifts ,\cf1  and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the country .\par
On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity . ''\par
`` Oh , \cf2 no !\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 Perhaps not with your tongue ,\cf1  my dear Watson , but certainly with your eyebrows .\par
But I was still far from satisfied .\par
`` You do yourself an injustice .\par
\cf2 Perhaps you can not yourself recall how your reverie commenced ?\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 No ,\cf1  \cf2 I can not .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 But it did not lead very far .\cf1\par
Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books .\par
\cf2 I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War ,\cf1  for I remember your expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people .\par
\cf2 You felt so strongly about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also .\cf1\par
You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life .\par
\cf2 I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day .\cf1\par
`` \cf2 No ,\cf1  \cf2 I saw nothing .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 There is no indication as to the sender ,\cf1  and the matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing , who is a maiden lady of fifty , has led a most retired life , and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post .\par
Some years ago , however , when she resided at Penge , she let apartments in her house to three young medical students , whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits .\par
We have , of course , wired to the Belfast post-office , but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that day , \cf2 and they have no means of identifying this particular one ,\cf1  or of remembering the sender .\par
\cf2 The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does not help us in any way .\cf1\par
`` \cf2 What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know nothing whatever about it ?\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 I have no doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 I wo n't have those things in here ,\cf1  Mr. Lestrade .\par
`` \cf2 I can not see the importance ,\cf1  '' said Lestrade .\par
What , \cf2 did you not observe it ?\cf1\par
\cf2 I think there can be no doubt of it .\cf1\par
The parcel was directed , then , by a man -- the printing is distinctly masculine -- of limited education and unacquainted with the town of Croydon .\par
`` You have observed , of course , '' said he at last , `` \cf2 that the ears are not a pair .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 But this is not a practical joke .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 These ears bear no signs of this .\cf1\par
Again , carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the medical mind , \cf2 certainly not rough salt .\cf1\par
\cf2 I repeat that there is no practical joke here ,\cf1  but that we are investigating a serious crime . ''\par
This brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror in the background .\par
The other is a man 's , sun-burned , discoloured , and also pierced for an earring .\par
She might have buried the ears , \cf2 and no one would have been the wiser .\cf1\par
\cf2 But if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name .\cf1\par
\cf2 I think that I have nothing further to learn from Miss Cushing .\cf1\par
`` I am convinced , sir , '' she said , `` that this matter is a mistake , \cf2 and that the parcel was never meant for me at all .\cf1\par
\cf2 I have not an enemy in the world ,\cf1  as far as I know , so why should anyone play me such a trick ? ''\par
I stared hard myself at her flat , grizzled hair , her trim cap , her little gilt earrings , her placid features ; but I could see nothing which could account for my companion 's evident excitement .\par
`` Oh , I am weary of questions ! '' cried Miss Cushing impatiently .\par
`` I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece , one of whom is undoubtedly yourself , \cf2 while the others are so exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the relationship .\cf1  ''\par
I observe that she was unmarried at the time . ''\par
He was on the South American line when that was taken , \cf2 but he was so fond of her that he could n't abide to leave her for so long ,\cf1  and he got into the Liverpool and London boats . ''\par
`` \cf2 No ,\cf1  the May Day , when last I heard .\par
First he dropped me , then he quarrelled with Sarah , \cf2 and now that Mary has stopped writing we do n't know how things are going with them .\cf1  ''\par
`` I wonder , since you are both maiden ladies , \cf2 that you do not keep house together .\cf1  ''\par
`` Ah ! you do n't know Sarah '\cf2 s temper or you would wonder no more .\cf1\par
\cf2 I do n't want to say a word against my own sister ,\cf1  but she was always meddlesome and hard to please , was Sarah . ''\par
\cf2 And now she has no word hard enough for Jim Browner .\cf1\par
Good-bye , and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a case with which , as you say , \cf2 you have nothing whatever to do .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 Our drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which we had just quitted .\cf1\par
As her medical adviser , \cf2 I can not possibly take the responsibility of allowing anyone to see her .\cf1\par
`` Well , if we ca n'\cf2 t we ca n't ,\cf1  '' said Holmes , cheerfully .\par
`` \cf2 Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much .\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 I did not wish her to tell me anything .\cf1\par
`` \cf2 I was never more serious in my life .\cf1\par
`` \cf2 You can not effect an arrest until to-morrow night at the earliest .\cf1\par
\cf2 I should prefer that you do not mention my name at all in connection with the case ,\cf1  as I choose to be only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in their solution .\par
`` \cf2 Your case is not complete ,\cf1  then ? '' I asked .\par
`` \cf2 And yet I can not see anything save very vague indications .\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 On the contrary ,\cf1  \cf2 to my mind nothing could be more clear .\cf1\par
\cf2 We had formed no theories .\cf1\par
`` As a medical man , you are aware , Watson , \cf2 that there is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear .\cf1\par
This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months , so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah , he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address .\par
`` A second solution was at this stage obviously possible , and although I thought it exceedingly unlikely , I was determined to elucidate it before going further .\par
An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner , and the male ear might have belonged to the husband .\par
Then , of course , she might give us very important information , \cf2 but I was not sanguine that she would .\cf1\par
\cf2 Nothing could be more conclusive .\cf1\par
When he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade , \cf2 and I have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations .\cf1\par
He jumped up when he heard my business , and I had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police , who were round the corner , \cf2 but he seemed to have no heart in him ,\cf1  and he held out his hands quietly enough for the darbies .\par
We brought him along to the cells , and his box as well , for we thought there might be something incriminating ; but , bar a big sharp knife such as most sailors have , \cf2 we got nothing for our trouble .\cf1\par
However , \cf2 we find that we shall want no more evidence ,\cf1  for on being brought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a statement , which was , of course , taken down , just as he made it , by our shorthand man .\par
The investigation really was a very simple one , '' remarked Holmes , `` \cf2 but I do n't think it struck him in that light when he first called us in .\cf1\par
\cf2 I do n't care a plug which you do .\cf1\par
I tell you I '\cf2 ve not shut an eye in sleep since I did it ,\cf1  \cf2 and I do n't believe I ever will again until I get past all waking .\cf1\par
I '\cf2 m never without one or the other before me .\cf1\par
It '\cf2 s not that I want to clear myself .\cf1\par
We were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together , \cf2 and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my Mary .\cf1\par
\cf2 But when little Mary was there I had never a thought of her ,\cf1  and that I swear as I hope for God 's mercy .\par
`` ` It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me , or to coax me out for a walk with her , \cf2 but I had never thought anything of that .\cf1\par
I was impatient and paced up and down the room .\par
`` It '\cf2 s a bad compliment to me that you ca n't be contented with my society for so short a time .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 There was no need for her to speak ,\cf1  \cf2 nor for me either .\cf1\par
I was a fool to let her go on biding with us -- a besotted fool -- \cf2 but I never said a word to Mary ,\cf1  for I knew it would grieve her .\par
Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable , \cf2 and we had ceaseless rows about nothing .\cf1\par
Sarah avoided me now , but she and Mary were just inseparable .\par
I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and poisoning my wife 's mind against me , \cf2 but I was such a blind beetle that I could not understand it at the time .\cf1\par
Then I broke my blue ribbon and began to drink again , \cf2 but I think I should not have done it if Mary had been the same as ever .\cf1\par
He was good company , \cf2 I wo n't deny it ,\cf1  and he had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man , so that I think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop than the forecastle .\par
For a month he was in and out of my house , \cf2 and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his soft ,\cf1  tricky ways .\par
I had come into the parlour unexpected , and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of welcome on my wife 's face .\par
\cf2 There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken for mine .\cf1\par
`` \cf2 Do n't ,\cf1  Jim , \cf2 do n't !\cf1  '' says she .\par
`` Sarah , '' says I as I went in , `` \cf2 this man Fairbairn is never to darken my door again .\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 Why not ?\cf1  '' says she .\par
`` Oh ! '' says she , `` \cf2 if my friends are not good enough for this house ,\cf1  \cf2 then I am not good enough for it either .\cf1  ''\par
She was frightened by my face , I think , \cf2 for she never answered a word ,\cf1  and the same evening she left my house .\par
`` ` Well , \cf2 I do n't know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of this woman ,\cf1  or whether she thought that she could turn me against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave .\par
\cf2 How often she went I do n't know ,\cf1  but I followed her one day , and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got away over the back garden wall , like the cowardly skunk that he was .\par
\cf2 There was no trace of love between us any longer .\cf1\par
`` ` Well , \cf2 Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool ,\cf1  so she went back , as I understand , to live with her sister in Croydon , and things jogged on much the same as ever at home .\par
The thought was in my head as I turned into my own street , and at that moment a cab passed me , and there she was , sitting by the side of Fairbairn , the two chatting and laughing , \cf2 with never a thought for me as I stood watching them from the footpath .\cf1\par
`` ` I tell you , and I give you my word for it , \cf2 that from that moment I was not my own master ,\cf1  and it is all like a dim dream when I look back on it .\par
I had a heavy oak stick in my hand , and I tell you I saw red from the first ; but as I ran I got cunning , too , \cf2 and hung back a little to see them without being seen .\cf1\par
There was a good crowd round the booking-office , \cf2 so I got quite close to them without being seen .\cf1\par
When we reached it they walked along the Parade , \cf2 and I was never more than a hundred yards from them .\cf1\par
There was a bit of a haze , \cf2 and you could not see more than a few hundred yards .\cf1\par
I cleaned myself up , got back to land , \cf2 and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of what had passed .\cf1\par
You can hang me , or do what you like with me , \cf2 but you can not punish me as I have been punished already .\cf1\par
\cf2 I can not shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at me --\cf1  staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze .\par
\cf2 You wo n't put me alone into a cell ,\cf1  sir ?\par
For pity '\cf2 s sake do n't ,\cf1  and may you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now . '\par
It must tend to some end , or else our universe is ruled by chance , which is unthinkable .\par
`` Well , Mrs. Warren , \cf2 I can not see that you have any particular cause for uneasiness ,\cf1  \cf2 nor do I understand why I ,\cf1  whose time is of some value , should interfere in the matter .\par
`` \cf2 But he would never cease talking of it --\cf1  your kindness , sir , and the way in which you brought light into the darkness .\par
\cf2 You do n't object to tobacco ,\cf1  I take it ?\par
You are uneasy , as I understand , \cf2 because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you can not see him .\cf1\par
Why , bless you , Mrs. Warren , \cf2 if I were your lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 I ca n't sleep for fright .\cf1\par
To hear his quick step moving here and moving there from early morning to late at night , \cf2 and yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of him --\cf1  it 's more than I can stand .\par
My husband is as nervous over it as I am , but he is out at his work all day , \cf2 while I get no rest from it .\cf1\par
` \cf2 If not ,\cf1  I '\cf2 ll have no more to do with you .\cf1  '\par
Also , \cf2 that he was to be left entirely to himself and never ,\cf1  upon any excuse , to be disturbed . ''\par
`` \cf2 Nothing wonderful in that ,\cf1  surely ? ''\par
`` \cf2 Not in reason ,\cf1  sir .\par
He has been there for ten days , and neither Mr. Warren , \cf2 nor I ,\cf1  \cf2 nor the girl has once set eyes upon him .\cf1\par
We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down , up and down , night , morning , and noon ; \cf2 but except on that first night he had never once gone out of the house .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 He told me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to bar the door .\cf1\par
Just the word , \cf2 nothing more .\cf1\par
`` Dear me , Watson , '' said Homes , staring with great curiosity at the slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him , `` this is certainly a little unusual .\par
`` \cf2 I can not imagine .\cf1  ''\par
The words are written with a broad-pointed , violet-\cf2 tinted pencil of a not unusual pattern .\cf1\par
`` Youngish , sir -- \cf2 not over thirty .\cf1  ''\par
`` Well , \cf2 can you give me no further indications ?\cf1  ''\par
Dark clothes -- \cf2 nothing you would note .\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 He gave no name ?\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 No ,\cf1  sir . ''\par
`` \cf2 And has had no letters or callers ?\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 None .\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 No ,\cf1  sir ; he looks after himself entirely . ''\par
`` He had one big brown bag with him -- \cf2 nothing else .\cf1  ''\par
`` Well , \cf2 we do n't seem to have much material to help us .\cf1\par
\cf2 Do you say nothing has come out of that room --\cf1  \cf2 absolutely nothing ?\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 There is nothing here ,\cf1  '' said he .\par
`` \cf2 I do n't understand that .\cf1\par
`` \cf2 No ,\cf1  \cf2 no ;\cf1  the end is matted .\par
\cf2 I suppose there could not be two people in your rooms ,\cf1  Mrs. Warren ? ''\par
`` \cf2 No ,\cf1  sir .\par
After all , \cf2 you have nothing to complain of .\cf1\par
You have received your rent , \cf2 and he is not a troublesome lodger ,\cf1  though he is certainly an unusual one .\par
He pays you well , \cf2 and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct business of yours .\cf1\par
\cf2 We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for it .\cf1\par
I 've taken up the matter , \cf2 and I wo n't lose sight of it .\cf1\par
`` Well , apart from this cigarette-end , \cf2 was it not suggestive that the only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms ?\cf1\par
\cf2 We have no proof that the person who came back was the person who went out .\cf1\par
I can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary , \cf2 which would give the noun but not the plural .\cf1\par
But surely the most valuable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual !\par
\cf2 This person is alone and can not be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired .\cf1\par
\cf2 There seems no other way ,\cf1  and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only .\par
` Surely Jimmy will not break his mother 's heart ' -- that appears to be irrelevant .\par
` If the lady who fainted on Brixton bus ' -- \cf2 she does not interest me .\cf1\par
` Every day my heart longs -- ' Bleat , Watson -- unmitigated bleat !\par
The mysterious one could understand English , \cf2 even if he could not print it .\cf1\par
\cf2 Nothing for a week after that .\cf1\par
That was in yesterday 's paper , and there is nothing in to-day 's .\par
If we wait a little , Watson , \cf2 I do n't doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible .\cf1  ''\par
`` I '\cf2 ll have no more of it !\cf1\par
Well , \cf2 this morning he had not gone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him ,\cf1  threw a coat over his head , and bundled him into a cab that was beside the curb .\par
\cf2 He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab .\cf1\par
`` \cf2 No ;\cf1  he is clean dazed .\par
`` Well , we '\cf2 ve lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came before .\cf1\par
Money '\cf2 s not everything .\cf1\par
\cf2 Do nothing rash .\cf1\par
\cf2 What they would have done had it not been a mistake ,\cf1  we can only conjecture . ''\par
`` \cf2 I do n't see how that is to be managed ,\cf1  unless you break in the door .\par
Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these , a row of residential flats , \cf2 which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye .\cf1\par
\cf2 What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman ,\cf1  \cf2 and no ordinary woman ,\cf1  Watson . ''\par
\cf2 It is not an easy problem ,\cf1  but he solved it in an original fashion , \cf2 and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food .\cf1\par
\cf2 The man can not come near the woman ,\cf1  or he will guide their enemies to her .\par
\cf2 Since he can not communicate with her direct ,\cf1  he has recourse to the agony column of a paper .\par
This much we can say : \cf2 that it is no ordinary love escapade .\cf1\par
The attack upon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy , whoever they are , \cf2 are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the male .\cf1\par
\cf2 I suppose when you doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee ?\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 Education never ends ,\cf1  Watson .\par
\cf2 There is neither money nor credit in it ,\cf1  and yet one would wish to tidy it up .\par
\cf2 That ca n't be all ,\cf1  Watson ?\par
\cf2 ATTENTA gives no sense .\cf1\par
\cf2 Nor is it any better as three words AT ,\cf1  TEN , TA , unless T. A. are a person 's initials .\par
\cf2 No ,\cf1  that seems to be the finish .\par
`` \cf2 And not a very obscure cipher ,\cf1  Watson , '' said he .\par
`` \cf2 Not a doubt of it .\cf1\par
There , dimly outlined at the top window , I could see the shadow of a head , a woman 's head , gazing tensely , rigidly , out into the night , waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message .\par
`` \cf2 How you got on to it I ca n't imagine .\cf1  ''\par
\cf2 But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in continuing this business .\cf1  ''\par
`` I 'll do you this justice , Mr. Holmes , \cf2 that I was never in a case yet that I did n't feel stronger for having you on my side .\cf1\par
We KNOW he is at the bottom of fifty murders , \cf2 and yet we have nothing positive we can take him on .\cf1\par
Mr. Gregson and I ran him to ground in that big tenement house , and there 's only one door , \cf2 so he ca n't slip us .\cf1\par
There 's three folk come out since he went in , but I '\cf2 ll swear he was n't one of them .\cf1  ''\par
`` I expect , as usual , \cf2 he knows a good deal that we do n't .\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 But we have no warrant for his arrest .\cf1  ''\par
`` He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances , '' said Gregson .\par
\cf2 When we have him by the heels we can see if New York ca n't help us to keep him .\cf1\par
Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence , \cf2 but never in that of courage .\cf1\par
On the deal boards of the carpetless floor there was outlined a fresh track of blood .\par
`` \cf2 Not much ,\cf1  Mr. Holmes , among the millions of London . ''\par
`` \cf2 Perhaps not .\cf1\par
`` \cf2 Your cipher was not difficult ,\cf1  madam .\par
`` \cf2 I do not understand how you know these things ,\cf1  '' she said .\par
`` Well , Mrs. Lucca , '' said the prosaic Gregson , laying his hand upon the lady 's sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a Notting Hill hooligan , `` \cf2 I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are ;\cf1  but you 've said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the Yard . ''\par
\cf2 But if you think that he has acted from motives which are not criminal ,\cf1  and which he would wish to have known , \cf2 then you can not serve him better than by telling us the whole story .\cf1  ''\par
`` \cf2 Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing ,\cf1  '' said the lady .\par
`` He was a devil and a monster , \cf2 and there can be no judge in the world who would punish my husband for having killed him .\cf1  ''\par
She spoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional English , which , for the sake of clearness , I will make grammatical .\par
\cf2 He had neither money nor position --\cf1  \cf2 nothing but his beauty and strength and energy --\cf1  so my father forbade the match .\par
\cf2 Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more happy than I was in his presence .\cf1\par
\cf2 Gennaro said nothing ,\cf1  but I , who knew him so well , \cf2 could read in his face some emotion which I had never seen there before .\cf1\par
At first I thought that it was dislike .\par
And then , gradually , I understood that it was more than dislike .\par
That night -- the night that I read his terror -- \cf2 I put my arms round him and I implored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from me ,\cf1  and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so .\par
The oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were frightful , \cf2 but once within its rule no escape was possible .\cf1\par
\cf2 Gennaro had not yet returned when he came .\cf1\par
\cf2 He struck Gennaro senseless and fled from the house which he was never more to enter .\cf1\par
By midday my husband and I were on our way to London , \cf2 but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of this danger ,\cf1  and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future .\par
\cf2 My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me .\cf1\par
\cf2 I do not myself know where he lived ,\cf1  or how .\par
`` Well , Mr. Gregson , '' said the American , looking across at the official , `` \cf2 I do n't know what your British point of view may be ,\cf1  but I guess that in New York this lady 's husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks . ''\par
`` If what she says is corroborated , \cf2 I do not think she or her husband has much to fear .\cf1\par
\cf2 But what I ca n't make head or tail of ,\cf1  Mr. Holmes , is how on earth YOU got yourself mixed up in the matter . ''\par
By the way , it is not eight o'clock , and a Wagner night at Covent Garden !\cf0\par
