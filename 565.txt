 all that time . Of course , 	so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all .	 But there is
 the sister , and the brother , 	the latter not a very strong man .	 They would be

 again on our walk home , 	and since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother and sister .	 One would imagine
 some attention to his sister . 	Yet I am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love ,	 and I have
-a-tete . By the way , 	your instructions to me never to allow Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties .	 Never was there
 either side of a question , 	so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly amusement .	 He is said
 he intends to prosecute Dr. 	Mortimer for opening a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down .	 I have already

 outfit having now all arrived . 	You are aware that I am not a very sound sleeper ,	 and since I

 the grandeur of his family . 	Between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing ,	 for I have
 our beautiful neighbour , Miss Stapleton . 	And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect .	 Today , for example
 I am sorry to intrude , 	but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you ,	 and especially that
 I should not leave you , 	and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor .	 '' `` My dear fellow
 Holmes , with all his wisdom , 	did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor .	 It might not
 have been on the moor . 	It might not even now be too late to overtake him ,	 so I set
